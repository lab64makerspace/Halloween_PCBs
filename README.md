## Halloween_PCBs

This repository has files associated with the lab64 Halloween PCB design workshop and the lab64 Halloween PCB soldering workshop.

The first group of PCB outlines (pumpkin, ghost, and cat) are provided so that folks can try the process of importing a board outline into KiCAD. Additional graphic features may be easily added by placing additional .dxf format graphics files on the appropriate PCB layer. For example, to emphasize the eyes of the ghost one may wish to import the file ghost_eyes.dxf onto the F.Silk layer when the board is open in Pcbnew. The color of soldermask and silkscreen may be selected when the boards files are sent to the fabrication vendor.

You can open the .dxf files in graphics programs such as Inkscape to add features. Just add the features you want, save the file, delete the original objects and save the additional features as a new .dxf file. This is how ghost_eyes.dxf was generated. Then to add the features to the PCB, simply execute a second import step onto the appropriate layer and viola!
